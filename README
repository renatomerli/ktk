  Libemface is a library for embedded interface building.

  The goal is to provide a embeddable interface builder for a set of "first level"
widgets, giving to user the ability to create its own interfaces and
re-configure it how many times he/she wants.

  Its not to embed glade, but give to the user the ability to edit Cartesian
positions and widget proprieties of labels, images, entrys and other GUI components 
in real time.


  At now, it currently have tree buildable components: image, label and a digital clock,
that can be partially edited it real time, but not yet saved or restored.
  So, it cannot be considered usable for its main use. I have released it in this
version so i can share the development problems and pleasure with others.
