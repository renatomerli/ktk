IMPORTANT: its a alpha release, API may change.


Enface library was built on three main objects: TParent, Widedit and Toolbox.

1. TParent: (TParent.h / cpp)
The main object is a container (a Gtk::Fixed) that hold all operations. It 
controls the interface and uses a internal child called TChild to do that.

To create a interface, use a this class, its allmost like a Gtk::Fixed and should
be used as it, so it can hold any Gtkmm widget. Its extra methods is:

void Ktk::TParent::set_description (Glib::ustring _descrition) (NOT READY)
sets a new interface from a descrition

void Ktk::TParent::set_background (Glib::ustring _filename)  
set the interface background to the image in the filename

Glib::ustring Ktk::TParent::set_description () (NOT READY) 
return a XML description of the interface currently displayed

void Ktk::TParent set_editmode (bool _editmode) 
set the mode of operation .When in editmode the child widgets can be edited and not
used.

bool Ktk::TParent get_editmode ()
get the current state o editmode

void Ktk::TParent set_movedark(bool _movedark)
set wherever the widgets should be moved with transperency or not

bool Ktk::TParent get_movedark()
get the current state o movedark

set_moving, set_clicked and other are for internal use.

void Ktk::Tparent::set_widedit (TParent::Widedit &_widedit)
sets the widget editor for the current interface, so it can updates it. See
bellow to know what is a widedit.


2. Widedit (widedit.h /cpp)

Its a widget to build a propriety editor for widgets. Need to overloaded to
recognize individual widgets.
Have methods to update only image or proprieties, or the two.

void Ktk::Widedit::set (Ktk::TChild & _tchild)
set _tchild to be to currently edited widget

void Ktk::Widedit::set_pixbuf (Glib::RefPtr<GdkPixbuf> _pbuf)
set _pbuf as the image of the currently edited widget

TChild * Ktk::TChild::get_widget()
get a pointer to the widget being currently edited

void update_allocation (GtkAllocation &_allocation)
updates the indication of the position of the current widget on the widedit


3. Toolbox  (toolbox.h /cpp)

Its just a model to build a toolbox. Its here for convenience. Should be
overladed to do any work.
Have empty methods for any buttons as:
cb_add_image, cb_add_label, and so on.
